The iPhone dev team will be the stewards of this code repository, and we will contribute as much code as we can safely release.

Contributions by the community are more than welcome!

We're going to try to make as much information publicly available as we can. If you would like sources for something we do to be made available here, please use the issues box to submit a request.
